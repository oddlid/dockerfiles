# Docker development environment

This is a Docker image for mainly Golang development in vim/neovim,
but with plugins and tools for a lot more. The intention is to get a
fully automated replica of the setup I currently use in a VM and in WSL.

## Included tools:

- bat
- build tools
- fzf
- git
- git-delta
- gitmux
- golang
- helm
- k9s
- kubectl
- nodejs
- npm
- nvim
- ripgrep (rg)
- silver searcher (ag)
- tmux
- vim
- weechat
- yarn
- zsh (oh-my-zsh)
